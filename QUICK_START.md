# Quick Start Guide - Standalone Version

## ✅ SOLUTION: Use standalone.html

The `index.html` file requires Node.js and npm to work. I've created **`standalone.html`** which works immediately without any installation!

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Double-Click (Easiest)
1. Navigate to: `C:\Users\Aysha\Desktop\My Softwares\Ac3\`
2. **Double-click `standalone.html`**
3. It will open in your default browser
4. Start adding customers immediately!

### Option 2: Right-Click
1. Right-click on `standalone.html`
2. Select "Open with" → Choose your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
3. Done!

## 📱 Features Available

All features work in the standalone version:
- ✅ Add customers
- ✅ Edit customers
- ✅ View customer details
- ✅ Delete customers
- ✅ Search by name or address
- ✅ Filter by payment status (All/Full/Partial/None)
- ✅ Data saves automatically (localStorage)
- ✅ Beautiful glassmorphic UI
- ✅ Fully responsive

## 💾 Data Storage

- Your customer data is saved in your browser's localStorage
- Data persists even after closing the browser
- Each browser stores data separately (Chrome data won't show in Edge)
- Clearing browser data will delete customers

## 🌐 Sharing the Application

### For Local Use Only:
Just use `standalone.html` - no deployment needed!

### To Deploy Online (Optional):
If you want to share it with your team online:

1. **Upload to Netlify** (Easiest):
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag and drop `standalone.html` into the upload area
   - Get a live URL instantly!

2. **Upload to GitHub Pages**:
